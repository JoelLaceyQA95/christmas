Let it snow! Let it snow! </br> </br>  When we finally kiss good-night </br> How I'll hate going out in the storm </br> But if you really grab me tight </br> All the way home I'll be warm </br> </br> The fire is slowly dying </br> And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing </br> But as long as you love me so </br> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow </br>"
